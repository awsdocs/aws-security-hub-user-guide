# Filtering and sorting the control finding list<a name="control-finding-list"></a>

The control finding list uses tabs to provide built\-in filtering for the list based on the finding status\. You can also filter the list based on other finding values\.

The **All checks** tab lists all active findings that have a workflow status of `NEW`, `NOTIFIED`, or `RESOLVED`\. By default, the list is sorted so that failed findings are at the top of the list\. This sort order calls attention to findings that need to be addressed\.

The lists on the **Failed**, **Unknown**, and **Passed** tabs are filtered based on the value of `Compliance.Status`\. The lists also only include active findings that have a workflow status of `NEW`, `NOTIFIED`, or `RESOLVED`\.

The **Suppressed** tab contains a list of active findings that have a workflow status of SUPPRESSED\.

In addition to the built\-in filters on each tab, you can filter the lists using text in the following fields:
+ Account ID
+ Workflow status
+ Compliance status
+ Resource ID
+ Resource type

You can sort each list using any of the columns\.
